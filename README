JUP (Javascript markUP) is an HTML/XML generator. It has a clear and concise syntax for declaring markup using JavaScript arrays. Since JUP is all javascript, you can introduce native iterators and functions into the structure definitions.



["div"] // Renders "<div></div>"

["div", { "class": "foo" }] // Renders "<div class='foo'></div>"

["div", { "class": "foo" }, "content"] // Renders "<div class='foo'>content</div>"

["div", { "class": "foo" }, ["div"], "content"] // Renders "<div class='foo'><div></div>content</div>"

["div", { "class": "foo" }, "content", ["div"]] // Renders "<div class='foo'>content<div></div></div>"

JUP also has the ability to combine markup generation with data (using a supplant/crockford-like syntax) for instance...

["div", { "class": "{{replaceme}}" }]


The following scores were gathered creating a DIV that contains two SPANs and two BRs, each span had a field of data from some JSON.
